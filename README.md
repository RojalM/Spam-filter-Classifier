# Spam or Ham Classifier

This project focuses on building a spam or ham classifier using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can distinguish between spam and legitimate messages (ham) based on their content.

## Key Steps:

1. **Cleaning Data**: Perform thorough data cleaning tasks, including removing unnecessary characters, handling missing values, and addressing data inconsistencies, to ensure the dataset is ready for further processing.

2. **Preprocessing**: Apply advanced preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and stemming or lemmatization to transform the textual data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert text data into a numerical representation.

3. **Prediction**: Build a high-performance prediction model that can accurately classify messages as spam or ham based on the preprocessed data. Experiment with various machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

4. **Training Model**: Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets. Train a neural network model, leveraging its ability to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data. Fine-tune the model's architecture and hyperparameters to optimize its performance.

The resulting model can be utilized in various applications, such as email spam filtering or message categorization. The project includes comprehensive documentation, well-commented code, and an evaluation of the model's performance. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
